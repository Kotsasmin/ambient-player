# YouTube Ambient Mode Replica

This project is my attempt to replicate the **YouTube Ambient Mode** using React. It allows you to load and play videos with a background effect that matches the colors of the video being played. The background transitions smoothly, creating a dynamic and immersive environment based on the colors of the video.

## Features:
- Load and play videos.
- Ambient background effect that reacts to video colors.
- Smooth transitions for the ambient background.
- Buttons for loading sample videos and custom videos from the user's device.
